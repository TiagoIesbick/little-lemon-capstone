# Front-End Developer Capstone

Challenge proposed in the Front-End Developer Capstone course by Meta.

# Scenario
First, let's list the Little Lemon ownersâ€™ (your client's) requirements:

- About Little Lemon

- Highlights and specials

- Descriptions and photos of dishes

- Navigation bar

- Footer

- Testimonials

After that.  The task is to improve the app by allowing the user to enter data into the form so that they can complete a table reservation.  Thus, you need to build a Booking Form component that has at least the following entries (form items):

Date

Time

Number of guests

Occasion (Birthday, Anniversary)

Submit reservation button (to submit the form)

To do this, you need to implement a form in a controlled component named BookingForm.
